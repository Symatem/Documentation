# SYMbol relAtion sysTEM (Symatem)

This project is a different approach to most practical parts of computer science:
- [Storing data](Storage.md)
- [Processing data](Processing.md)
- [And tools to develop software](Tools.md)

If you give it a try, you will find out soon, that even though some things are familiar others are completely alien to you.
I recommend [this WBW Post](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html) about thinking differently in general.

I tried to break things down to their basic elements and rearrange them in a useful way regardless of how most others are doing them nowadays.
Therefore this project is a unique way of replacing all of these components by a unified system:
- Programming Language
- Database
- Ontology Engine
- File System
- Operating System
- Version Control System
- Development Environment
